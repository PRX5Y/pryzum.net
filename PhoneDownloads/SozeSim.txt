    we need to request the report of aziz's death, 
    we also need to file charges against all of the Council 
    - crane included, whoever authorized the lawlessness inside 
    the prison and allowed carmine etc to do what ever they want 
    is responsible for that death

    "Mistrials may only be called and approved by a Judicial 
    Power of whom is presiding over the case in which the mistrial
    is designated."

    to motion for a mistrial if any rights herein are violated 
    during due process or trials."

    I was detained for "joy riding" while returning a car for my
    own safety as it was parked in the middle of the highway

    I have been held in jail for a charge that was posted on the
    docket, with no PC or Evidence, which BOTH are required, "AND"
    is a keyword, not just PC to hold me in jail

    I was detained by an officer out of los santos city, who only
    appears to have power in los santos as implied by the mayor 
    and council

    I have not been informed or shown any of the filings which are
    requested by legislation to do so

    Kael Soze:
    [2 months ago]
    I do not believe, that a person who was not involved in a 
    situation, can be used as a witness for PC, so I am unsure 
    why the council lady is allowed to be any type of evidence 
    in this situation

    Kael Soze:
    [2 months ago]
    im sure there is more rights that has been violated by the law 
    you enact, please be sure to let me know if you can find any.

    id love to see the summary of request, any time you have the time, 
    as i dont want to be violated for much longer please

    Kael Soze:
    [2 months ago]
    also, i know its unlikely you will read this, just like the 
    constitution, but I thought id give it a shot and save it for a

    JUDGE GAT
    [2 months ago]
    Last thing first, as it pertains to approving the HUT, I had a 
    face-to-face meeting with Sheriff Bones in which the report was 
    furnished for me to assess and approve.

    Kael Soze:
    [2 months ago]
    right, once its posted as a case, it says you need to have PC AND 
    evidence

    JUDGE GAT
    [2 months ago]
    That report should have been made available to you upon the filing 
    of the Docket case. The fact that it wasn't is a problem that I've 
    already brought up

    Kael Soze:
    [2 months ago]
    it also says that both parties must receive it

    Kael Soze:
    [2 months ago]
    it wasnt, my rights were violated, im so sorry this happened to me.

    JUDGE GAT
    [2 months ago]
    As I have been firmly conflicted out of taking any part in your trial,
    I have been trying my best to be a go between for these complaints 
    lodged by you and your attorney and the other judges.

    Kael Soze:
    [2 months ago]
    end of the day, im just informing you that my rights were violated, 
    while you may think its minor, the legislation states any person of 
    power, attorney or judge, which are all informed mind you, should 
    request a mistrial.

    Kael Soze:
    [2 months ago]
    you wouldnt want to disobey "state" law would you?

    JUDGE GAT
    [2 months ago]
    Unfortunately, all that I can do right now independently is offer 
    a bail hearing should you and your attorney feel prepared for one

    Kael Soze:
    [2 months ago]
    i think thats treason or w/e

    JUDGE GAT
    [2 months ago]
    Trust me, I do not think it is minor and I am trying my very best 
    within my very limited power to get it investigated and addressed 
    properly

    Kael Soze:
    [2 months ago]
    you do not have limited power, you have power to file mistrial 
    and make them refile it, unsure what you mean

    Kael Soze:
    [2 months ago]
    it says right there in the constitution

    JUDGE GAT
    [2 months ago]
    Just please trust me when I tell you that I'm working on it

    JUDGE GAT
    [2 months ago]
    I know you have no reason to trust me, but still, I'm gonna ask

    it says government entities not state government

    due process may be possible due to constitution breach

    Hey Mr. Soze, i looked into the million dollar question
    you asked me over the weekend. I'll admit, I'm left with
    more questions than answers and honestly i'm not sure what
    to believe anymore. Everything is written for Los Santos

    I have been given some 'friendly advice' from the Judge taking lead 
    over your case and that was to 'control my client'. It seems he isn't 
    pleased with what/how you have been posting on the docket

    It's meant to be a deterrent to not do crime in government buildings 
    but I thought them invoking federal authority in the name was interesting
